# Work Day Scheduler

This website showcases skills learned during module 5 of The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. Javascript was used to write the functions that enable the website to provide a daily scheduler for work hours. Content can be added and deleted directly in the app without use of forms. Content also logs to local storage and persists based on the user.

## How the Scheduler Is Used
The user will click the the middle column to add tasks to the selected hour. When finished the save button should be clicked in the same row for that hour for it to save to local storage. The row's color will changed based on if the time period exists in the past/current/future.

## Javascript Used
* Only vanilla JS was used for this project. I deemed it more beneficial to learn how to achieve the desired result with vanilla over jQuery due to advice given from personal references from developer friends.
* I also didn't use moment.js for any time features. Moment.js is end of life and vanilla JS provides the functions needed to make this app work.
